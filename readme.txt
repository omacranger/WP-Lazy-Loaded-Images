A simple plugin to enable lazy loading for all images using WordPress image functions.

== Description ==

A simple plugin to enable lazy loading for all images using WordPress image functions, or embedded into posts and pages using the WordPress dashboard.

The plugin works by replacing the original image source with a blank transparent gif via datauri. Reducing page load speed, network requests, and saving bandwidth for host and visitors unless they scroll where an image is in view. The plugin makes use of the fantastic [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes) javascript library.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Verify PHP extension requirements from the FAQ section
2. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-lazy-loaded-images` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
4. That's it! It should automatically replace images used inside of posts / pages (where passed through properly in themes), plugins, and more.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I change the default placeholder color? =

As of 2.0.0, Images now load as a transparent gif, which should remove the need to add custom image colors, and make it work in more situations automatically.

= Fade in images as they load =

With the new lazy load library, a few helper CSS classes are included by default. The full documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes#css-api), but the gist of it [pulled from the github repo] is as follows:

     /* fade image in after load */
     .lazyload,
     .lazyloading {
     	opacity: 0;
     }
     .lazyloaded {
     	opacity: 1;
     	transition: opacity 300ms;
     }

= Fallback =

As of 1.4.0, the plugin also adds support for a `noscript` fallback so the images will appear in browsers that might have Javascript disabled.

To take full advantage of this, the plugin provides a fully automatic solution using the following filter to your `functions.php`, `add_filter( 'lazy_load_enable_fallback', '__return_true' )`. This method will automatically handle all of the below instructions. If you're developing a custom theme you might want to include the following instructions manually, in that case you can use `add_filter( 'lazy_load_enable_noscript', '__return_true' )` to only add the `<noscript>` tags and leave the styles, javascript, and body classes untouched.

**NOTE:** This fallback only works on the images that are replaced inside the body of the pages, and those generated by using `the_post_thumbnail`.

Add the following CSS:

     .no-js .lazyload.lazy-fallback {
          display: none;
     }

Add the following JS inside as close to the opening `body` tag as possible:

     <script type="text/javascript">
        var body = document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0];
        if (body != undefined) {
          body.setAttribute('class', body.getAttribute('class').replace('no-js', ''));
        }
     </script>

And append this snippet to your functions.php:

     add_filter( 'body_class', function ( $classes, $class ) {
        if ( ! in_array( 'no-js', $classes ) ) {
           $classes[] = 'no-js';
        }

        return $classes;
     }, 10, 2 );

= Requirements =

The plugin requires the below PHP Extensions in order to properly function: 

* `gd` - To create placeholder images
* `xml` - To properly parse HTML inside post contents and enable automatic creation of lazy loaded images
* `mbstring` - To handle encoding of HTML & Unicode characters while parsing
