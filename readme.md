# WP Lazy Loaded Images

A simple plugin to enable lazy loading for all images using WordPress image functions, or embedded into posts and pages using the WordPress dashboard.

The plugin works by replacing the original image source with a blank white, which can be changed via filters, image via datauri. Reducing page load speed, and saving bandwidth for host and visitors.
