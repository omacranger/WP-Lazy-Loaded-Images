# WP Lazy Loaded Images

A simple WordPress plugin to enable lazy loading for all images using native image functions, or embedded into posts and pages using the WordPress dashboard.

The plugin works by replacing the original image source with a blank transparent gif via datauri. Reducing page load speed, network requests, and saving bandwidth for host and visitors unless they scroll where an image is in view.
